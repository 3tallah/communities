AGENDA
9:30-10:00 Morning Coffee
10:00-10:45 G. Markou: Bicep Your Way to Better Infrastructure: The Code You Can't Live Without!
Bicep is a new language from Microsoft that makes it easier to create, deploy and manage infrastructure in the cloud. With Bicep, you can automate the creation and deployment of infrastructure resources, saving time and reducing the risk of human error. In this presentation, you will learn how to use Bicep to deploy resources to Azure, and take advantage of advanced features like modules, parameters and expressions. Whether you are a developer, infrastructure engineer or IT pro, this presentation is for you. Join me and discover why Bicep is the code you cannot live without!
10:45-11:30 O. Meikopoulos: Planning and deploying carbon aware applications in the cloud
Everything starts with an epic energy transition that is happening in our days, moving away from fossil fuels and towards greener energy sources like the renewable photovoltaic panels and wind turbines.
From the IT industry’s perspective, we are contributing to this cause through the development of Green Software, which is responsible for emitting fewer greenhouse gases.
Carbon aware computing refers to the practice of designing, building, and operating computer systems with the goal of minimizing their carbon footprint.
This can include things like the cloud efficiency. The basic idea is doing more in your software when the carbon intensity is low and doing less when the carbon intensity is high.
11:30-12:00 Break
12:00-12:45 C.Spanougakis: Microsoft Defender: Elevate your security in the cloud
Σε αυτή την παρουσίαση θα δούμε το πιο παρεξηγημένο feature της Microsoft σε ότι αφορά την ασφάλεια στο cloud. Θα εξερευνήσουμε τα χαρακτηριστικά του και θα δούμε μέσα από demos τι μπορεί να προσφέρει και πώς ενσωματώνεται στο Microsoft Azure.

12:45-14:00 K.Ziazios: Build Scalable .NET Applications with Azure CosmosDB and Azure Container Registry
In this presentation we will learn the essentials of building scalable .NET applications with Cosmos DB and Azure Container Registry. We learn about Cosmos DB, a globally distributed, multi-model database service, and Azure Container Registry, a managed container registry. Through hands-on examples, from data modeling and partitioning strategies in Cosmos DB to efficient containerized deployment with Azure Container Registry, we will learn the best practices for unleashing the full potential of Cosmos DB and Azure Container Registry to supercharge your .NET applications
14:00-14:30 Networking
