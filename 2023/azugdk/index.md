# Azure User Group Denmark

![azug logo][2]

## What

Danish Microsoft Azure Usergroup for anyone and everyone interested in Microsoft Azure.

The goal of this group is to inform and educate people who are interested in the Microsoft Azure Platform, because we think its the best cloud provider out there.

Through this group you will find regular meetups with sessions about a specific Azure-related topic, and occasional workshops. We try to cater to both Developers and IT-Pro's and those in between - the DevOps.

Anyone who is interested in presenting about a Azure-related topic is more then welcome to get in touch with the organizers. You are also very welcome to suggest topics to the group.
