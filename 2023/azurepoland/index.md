# Event description

Title: **GitHub - building a conteniriezed app release to Azure using alternative to Azure DevOps**

The workshop is a training session aimed at teaching participants how to build and release applications to Microsoft Azure using GitHub instead of Azure DevOps.

During the workshop, participants will learn how to set up a GitHub repository for a conteniriezed test application, configure the necessary GitHub Actions workflows for building and testing the application code, and then deploy the application to Azure using an alternative to Azure DevOps, such as the GitHub actions.

The workshop is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, and cloud engineers who are familiar with both GitHub and Azure and want to learn how to integrate the two platforms for building and releasing applications. The workshop will cover key concepts and best practices for using GitHub and Azure together, as well as hands-on exercises to help participants apply what they have learned.
