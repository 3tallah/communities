# Azure Sydney User Group - Global Azure Day 2023
 
We are excited to bring back in-person events and host Global Azure Day 2023 for the Sydney community.

Global Azure is from the community, for the community. During this global event, communities worldwide will be organising local editions, like this one for Sydney.

Planning for the day is still underway, and our schedule will be updated as we go. We are considering holding a full day event covering a broad range of Azure topics.

More details will follow via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Sydney-User-Group/).

If you have any questions, feedback or thoughts, please get in touch with the community [leadership team](https://www.meetup.com/azure-sydney-user-group/members/?op=leaders).
