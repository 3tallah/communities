In May, those clear blue skies in Mumbai herald the annual Global Azure Bootcamp.

We are calling all Azure enthusiasts from Mumbai and nearby environs to come and join us, where we share our expertise and experience.

We encourage folks identifying themselves as part of an underrepresented minority[URM] in the Mumbai technology ecosystem to attend.

While we are keeping our fingers crossed for an in-person event, we cannot forget what happened last year when the Delta variant wrecked havoc in India and we had to cancel the bootcamp. We will communicate any status change asap.

This will be our 3rd Azure Global Bootcamp, previous editions were held in  [2018](https://gab18mum.eventbrite.com/) and [2019](https://gab19mum.eventbrite.com/).
