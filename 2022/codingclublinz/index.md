# Austrian Edition of Global Azure 2022

Global Azure is a 3-day virtual conference in which communities around the world organize live streams to learn about Cloud Computing and Microsoft Azure. This is the [Austrian edition of Global Azure 2022](https://globalazure.at/) provided by the Coding Club Linz.

**Join us on Friday, May 6, 2022!**

## We Are Virtual

The current Covid-situation would make it very difficult for us to invite you all to Linz (Austria). Like last year, Global Azure 2022 will be a virtual event again. This year, we prepare an even better online experience with stages, sessions, a virtual expo with our great sponsor, and lots of possibilities to network with other people passionate about cloud computing.

## Everything Live

At Global Azure Austria, nearly all sessions including live demos will be performed live. Therefore, speakers can answer questions and interact with the audience during their talks.

## German and English Content

The majority of our sessions will be in German. However, in order to offer content for a broad audience, some speakers have agreed to deliver their sessions in English so that people who do not understand German fluently can participate in the event, too.
