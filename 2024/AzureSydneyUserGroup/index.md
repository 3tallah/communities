We are thrilled to announce the return of the in-person event and the hosting of Global Azure Day 2024 for the Sydney community.

Global Azure is from the community, for the community. During this global event, communities worldwide will organise local editions, like this one for Sydney.

We are currently in the process of planning our schedule for the day. A full-day Azure event covering diverse topics is being strongly considered, and we will keep you updated as we finalise the details.

More details will follow via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Sydney-User-Group/).

If you have any questions, feedback or thoughts, please get in touch with the community [leadership team](https://www.meetup.com/azure-sydney-user-group/members/?op=leaders).
