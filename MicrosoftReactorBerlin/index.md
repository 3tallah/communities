Global Azure London

We're excited to be hosting an event at the Microsoft Reactor in Berlin on May 12th!

Expect a day packed full of awesome Azure talks, covering everything from PaaS, DevOps, IoT, AI / ML, security, tooling, and beyond.

This is also a great chance to network with MVPs and experts in the Azure world.

Talks will be delivered to our live audience and streamed on the Microsoft Developers YouTube channel.

If you have any questions, feedback or thoughts, please reach out to the community organisers:
